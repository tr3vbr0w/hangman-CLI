# hangman-CLI

Welcome to the wasach peaks word guess, hangman edition. Here I used constructor functions to create a hangman style game through git bash, the unix command line interface. To play the game, download the files from the repo,create your own .gitignore for your node modules, and run the index.js file.

The game will run, populating a string of underscore place holders to be checked against each guess. Once a correct guess in entered, the word constructor will populate the letter in its correct index within the word array.
